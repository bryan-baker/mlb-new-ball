 Major League Baseball saw a record 6,776 home runs hit in 2019, a whopping 671 more than the previous record set in 2017. Following the 2019 season, the league commissioned a 10-person team of scientists to determine why the baseballs seemed to carry more than previous seasons. The committee of scientists determined that small inconsistencies in seam height on the baseballs contributed to the home run surge. Â Although balls were not intentionally altered in 2019, MLB announced they would alter the balls in the 2021 season to address the surge of home runs.
